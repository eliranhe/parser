invoice-parser
==============

Yo, this invoice parser, parses the employees unique formatting and writes it to a new file.

In order to run this you'll need .NET framework 4.5 (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653).

Just go to the "binaries" folder and type "InvoicesParser.exe <InputFile> <OutputFile>".

In order to browse the code easily, Visual Studio 2012 (or higher) is recommended.

Enjoy!
